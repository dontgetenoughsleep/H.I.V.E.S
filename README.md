# KEYNOTE PORTRAIT

## Description
First item on my list is the keynote portrait. This is simply a poster (similar to displate) that will play a specific song to a connected bluetooth speaker. Idealy this is the order of which I would like it to work:
### Main flow
- Pair poster with H.I.V.E.S system once (can be through RF to give H.I.V.E.S the poster's unique ID)
- Once connected, user can hit a "play" button on the poster
- the poster will then send a pre-saved song to H.I.V.E.S system
- H.I.V.E.S will select a bluetooth speaker and play selected song

### Details
- More than one poster ID can be saved within the H.I.V.E.S system but only one can be selected to play a song at a time
- The poster will have 1 button; holding down will send unique ID to H.I.V.E.S
- 1 quick press of the button will send a request (PLAY or STOP) to H.I.V.E.S
- 2 quick presses of the button will send a REPLAY request to H.I.V.E.S
- Say there are 2 posters connected with this H.I.V.E.S system (poster A and poster B). If poster A is playing a song and the user selects poster B to play a song, H.I.V.E.S will stop poster A and play poster B 

### Possible Additions
- posters can hold albums and playlists
- posters can hold custom voice recordings
